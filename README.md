# Optimization Algorithm Visualizer

## Live Demo
https://omprakash-optimization-klef.streamlit.app/

## Description
This project visualizes optimization algorithms like:
- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing

It helps understand how optimization works step by step.# Optimization Algorithm Visualizer

Interactive Streamlit apps for four optimization algorithms.
Each student should fork this repo, deploys their own copy, and submits their Streamlit Cloud link.

## Apps included

| App | Algorithm | Problem |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Unconstrained Minimization | SD vs Newton vs CG on any 2D function |
| 2 | Pareto Front | Multi-objective trade-off visualization |
| 3 | Genetic Algorithm | 0/1 Knapsack |
| 4 | Simulated Annealing | Exam Timetable Scheduling |

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run Home.py
```

## Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (free — get a shareable link)

1. Fork or push this repo to your GitHub account
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
3. Click **New app**
4. Select your repo, branch = `main`, main file = `Home.py`
5. Click **Deploy** — you get a public link like:
   `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`
